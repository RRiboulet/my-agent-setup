# Agent Notes

## Releases

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for the release.
2. Commit the release changes.
3. Tag with the version and push commits and tags.

Versions are git tags. This repository is not published to npm.

## Extensions

Pi extensions live in `./.pi/extensions` and skills in `./.pi/skills`. When
working in this repo, add or update them there.

You can consult pi for reference — the installed `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
docs at `/usr/lib/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/` are the
source of truth for the API this code targets — but do not modify pi itself.

## Tests

```bash
bash .pi/extensions/subagent/test/setup-deps.sh              # once: link pi's packages
node --test .pi/extensions/subagent/test/*.test.ts
```

Run it with `bash` (or `sh`), not as `./setup-deps.sh` — see "Line endings"
below. Node runs the TypeScript directly; there is no build step. See
`.pi/extensions/subagent/test/README.md` for what is and is not covered.

## Line endings

`.gitattributes` sets `* text=auto eol=lf`, so git *normalizes* CRLF away on
comparison. Two consequences that `git status` cannot surface:

- A file whose blob is LF may still be **CRLF in your working tree** if it was
  checked out before `.gitattributes` existed. It shows as clean, yet bash
  fails on it (`$'\r': command not found`, `set: pipefail: invalid option`).
- `git add` does not fix an already-CRLF blob retroactively for files the
  attribute did not apply to when they were first committed.

If a shell script fails inexplicably, check it before trusting `git status`:

```bash
grep -qU $'\r' <file> && echo "CRLF in working tree"
```

Repair the whole tree with:

```bash
git add --renormalize .
git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm -f && git checkout-index -a -f   # re-checkout applies eol=lf
```

Keep shell files LF. The devcontainer bakes them in verbatim, and a trailing
`\r` ends up inside sourced paths (`~/.aliases.zsh^M`).
